    <h1>Rayong</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>During the late Ayutthaya period, when the former capital of Thailand was being destroyed by the invading Burmese. 
    general Phaya Tak marched his troops to Rayong in order to build up his navy before proceeding on to Chanthaburi. 
    He was later anointed "king" in Rayong. 
    Phaya Tak later became King Taksin of the Kingdom of Thonburi. 
    After which he returned to Ayutthaya, defeated the Burmese and set up a new capital in Thonburi.
    Yomjinda Road bisects one of Rayong's oldest settlements. 
    The road follows the Rayong River which, in the reign of King Rama VI, was the chief means of transport. 
    The community rehabilitated the old town and today it has become a tourist destination.</p><br>
